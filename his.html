<h1>Mexican History</h1>
<p>Mexico is a country with a rich History, being the third largest country in Latin America and having
history that traces back all the way back to pre-colonizational periods.</p>

<h1>Its Beagnnings</h1>
<h3>Pre-Columbian Period</h3>
<p>The history of Mexico begins with the indigenous peoples who inhabited the region long before the arrival of Europeans.
These civilizations include the <em>Olmec</em>, <em>Maya</em>, <em>Zapotec</em>, and <em>Aztec</em> cultures, which flourished from about 1200 BCE until 
the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.</p>

<h3>Colonial Period</h3>
<p>In 1519, the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico and began the process of colonization. 
The Aztec Empire was conquered in 1521, and Mexico became a Spanish colony known as New Spain. Over the next three centuries, 
the Spanish imposed their language, culture, and religion on the indigenous peoples of Mexico.</p>

<h1>The Middle</h1>
<h3>Independece Movement</h3>
<p>In 1810, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla launched a rebellion against the Spanish, sparking the Mexican War of Independence. 
The war lasted for over a decade and ended in 1821 with the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba, which granted Mexico its independence.</p>

<h3>Post-Independece Period</h3>
<p>After gaining independence, Mexico went through a period of political instability, with a series of coups and changes in government.
 In 1846, Mexico went to war with the United States over the annexation of Texas, which Mexico had previously claimed as part of its 
territory. The war ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ceded much of Mexico's northern territory to the United States.</p>

<h1>Recent History</h1>
<h3>Revolution Period</h3>
<p>In 1910, the Mexican Revolution began as a rebellion against the Díaz dictatorship. The revolution was led by a diverse group of
rebels, including Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa, and Venustiano Carranza. The war lasted for almost a decade and resulted in the 
establishment of a new constitution and a more democratic government.</p>

<h3>Modern Mexico</h3>
<p>In the years since the revolution, Mexico has undergone many changes and challenges, including economic struggles, 
political corruption, and a long-running conflict with drug cartels. Today, Mexico is a federal republic with a presidential 
system of government, and its economy is one of the largest in the world. Mexican culture and traditions continue to be a source 
of pride and identity for its people.</p>
